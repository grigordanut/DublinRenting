# DublinRenting Project
The project is a website developed on the Microsoft Visual Studio platform using a C# programming language. 
The website can be used by a rental company that manages different properties for rent (houses, flats, apartments) in different cities in Ireland. 
The project contains tables with the branches, staff, properties for rent, renters, owners of the property, and the viewing of the properties to be rented by potential renters.
The project shows the opportunities, challenges, benefits, and advantages of using the Visual Studio platform when creating a new website.
