# DublinRenting Project
The purpose of this project is to show the ways and strategies to develop a website on the Microsoft Visual Studio platform using a C# programming language. The final project will be a website used by a renting company that manages different properties for rent (houses, flats, apartments) in different cities in Ireland. The project will contain the tables with the branches, staff, properties for rent, renters, owners of the property, and the viewing of the properties to be rented by potential renters. The project will show the opportunities, challenges, benefits, and advantages of using the Visual Studio platform when creating a new website.
